# Proofscape Doc Modules

In some cases, documentation on the Proofscape language, and on PISE
(Proofscape Integrated Study Environment), is best written in
Proofscape modules, and viewed within PISE itself. This repo is a place to
write such "doc modules".


## How to contribute

Contributions are made by forking this repository, adding or improving
modules, and making a pull request. Please be sure to read

Proofscape modules can be developed using

the Proofscape Integrated Study Environment.
