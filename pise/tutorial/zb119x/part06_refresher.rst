=========
Refresher
=========

It's been a while, so we might want to refresh ourselves on what we're
here to prove. Let's therefore close the proof and review the theorem statement.
To do that, you can either |w47: click here|, or else close the proof yourself by
right-clicking anywhere in its grey background, and selecting "Close" from the
context menu.

.. |w47: click here| pfsc-chart::
    :offBoard: Thm119.Pf
    :view: Thm119.Thm

If you tried it yourself and you accidentally closed not just the proof but the
theorem too (and are now staring at a blank chart area), the "click here" widget
from the last paragraph will get you back where you need to be.

I leave you to re-read the theorem statement.
Remember that you can access the running definitions from the theorem's
context menu (right-click). When you are ready, let's return to |w48: the proof|.

.. |w48: the proof| pfsc-chart::
    :view: "Thm119.{Thm,Pf}"
    :layout: "KLayDown"
