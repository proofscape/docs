======================
Plan of the Discussion
======================

As is so often the case, we can conduct a motivated walk through the argument
by working "backwards" from the conclusion. But this is only really "backwards" if we
regard the conclusion as coming at the "end" of the argument.
One of the beauties of an argument map is that it sets us free from such linear
ordering.
In order to promote a different
point of view, we might want to |w50: flip the diagram|.
Now we can start with |w51: the concluding step|, and work our way down.

.. |w50: flip the diagram| pfsc-chart::
    :layout: "KLayUp"

.. |w51: the concluding step| pfsc-chart::
    :view: ["Thm119.Thm.A", "Thm119.Pf.{A170,A240,Thm118}"]
    :select: Thm119.Thm.A

Of course this isn't necessary, it just promotes a different way of looking at
things. If you preferred the old layout, you can go to the "Chart" menu, and use
the "Layout" option to go back to "FlowChart Down." It's up to you. In fact,
some may even prefer the "OrderedList" layout you find there. It's your choice.
