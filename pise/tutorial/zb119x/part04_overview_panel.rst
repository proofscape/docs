==================
The Overview Panel
==================

Now that we are zoomed in closer, the text is legible, but you may feel that you
are getting lost. Click the "Chart" menu at the top-right of the screen,
find "Inset", and then select the bottom-left corner for the inset panel to appear.

You should now see the inset panel in the lower-left corner of the chart area.
(At the moment it may not look like much more than a blank square.)
If you move your mouse pointer over the inset panel, you should see two tabs:
"Neighborhood" and "Overview". Select "Overview." This should help.

Now try panning around the main diagram with your mouse or trackpad as before,
and observe that there is a moving blue box inside the overview panel.
This represents your view. You can also click and drag this
blue box in order to pan. Try using this to pan between the premises and
conclusion of the theorem. (If you're having trouble finding them, you can always
use the last two widgets in the previous section.)
