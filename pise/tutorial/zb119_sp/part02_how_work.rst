===================
How does this work?
===================

The bits of text you've been clicking are called "widgets,"
and if you right-click
any widget and select "View Source" you'll see the source code that generated the
notes you are now reading.

Similarly, right-clicking any node in the chart panel will reveal a "View Source"
option that will show you how the chart is coded.

The application you're using right now is called PISE (Proofscape
Integrated Study Environment), and it is both a place to develop and build
these *source modules*, as well as to study the *notes* and *charts* they
produce, as you are now doing.
If you were working on modules you owned, then instead of "View Source," you would
see "Edit Source."

You can learn to code Proofscape modules from `the docs`_. For now, close any source
modules you may have opened, and we'll get back to studying Theorem 119.
