===================
Opening the Theorem
===================

Let's begin by examining :pfsc-chart:`w23: the theorem <"Thm119.Thm">`.
(Please click the words "the theorem" if you haven't already!)
You should now see a representation of Theorem 119 in a new panel
beside these notes. We'll call that the "chart panel."
If you're using a large display, you might want to grab the vertical
bar that separates the chart from
these notes and drag it this way, to give the chart more space.

If you right-click anywhere in the grey background of the "Theorem 119" box
in the diagram, you will see an option for "Running defs".
Select this, and you will see the running definitions
for $@ell$, $@zeta$, and $k$ that are in effect for this theorem:
$@ell$ is the odd prime whose cyclotomic field $@k = bbQ(zeta)$ we
are examining. Hit :kbd:`Esc` or click in the background of the chart to
take this menu away.

As the diagram shows, we are
:pfsc-chart:`w37: considering <"Thm119.Thm.I1">`
(please keep clicking the links
as you read!) a rational prime $p$ different from $@ell$, and we
want to establish
:pfsc-chart:`w38: the way this prime factors <"Thm119.Thm.A">`
in the field $k$. Please take
a moment and review the full theorem statement as presented in the diagram.
