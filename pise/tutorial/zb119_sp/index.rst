====================
Theorem 119 Tutorial
====================


This is an introductory tutorial on PISE, the Proofscape Integrated
Study Environment.

We use Theorem 119 of Hilbert's *Zahlbericht* as an example, giving us
something to look at, but the tutorial is all about introducing the features
of PISE, and showing you how to use them. You don't need to be interested in
algebraic number theory.

You can control the text size using the zoom setting under the Config menu.
There you'll also find a light mode / dark mode setting.
